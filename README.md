# Side Scroller HTML 5 Game.


## An arcade like side scrolling shooter I'm programming using phaser framework.

### How to run:

* To run the game, git clone it to a directory and run a local server from your command line.

 python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

### How to play:

* To move the player, use the directional pads, up is to jump.

* To shoot, hit the spacebar while holding the direction you want to shoot at. You can also shoot down by hitting down on the directional pad.

* Alien invaders are here to take over! Shoot all of the aliens to clear the stage and start the next stage of enemies. Your score will keep going up each round until you lose all your hearts. Once you lose all the lives you restart the game with a fresh canvas.

* Shooting aliens with give you 200 points, collecting gems will give you 100 points, and clearing the stage will give you 500 points.
